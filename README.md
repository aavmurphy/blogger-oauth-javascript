# blogger-oauth-javascript
Example using OAuth and Javascipt to log in to Blogger, then make an API v3 call to publish future dated posts.

Do you need OAuth? Yes if you are using any non-public API calls.

Follow the loose instructions on the Blogger API V3 page to sign up for a Google Cloud Account. Create a project. Add Blogger API V3 to it, Create an API_KEY and a CLIENT_ID

Now, look at the code. You'll need to edit the stuff at the top

Then open the page in your browser.

You'll need to edit the URL line (this example was taken from something specific to avid a bug in the Blogger API)

Hope this helps
